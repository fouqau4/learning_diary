load a file :
	load('filename');
check all exicted variables :
	who
return element number of vector, or row or colomn number of matrix ( depends on which is greater ) :
	length(variable)
elements operation between matrix :
	bsxfun(@fun, op1, op2 );
	// reference : http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/bsxfun.html
fminunc is an optimization solver that finds the minimum of an unconstrained function :
	fminunc(@fun, initial_theta, option,...);
	* set the GradObj option to on, which tells fminunc that our function returns both the cost and the gradient
